# Ride Sharing Web App Implementation Plan

## 1. Project Setup
- [x] Initialize React + Vite project
- [x] Set up sass
- [x] Create basic project structure

## 2. Frontend Components
### Core Components
- [x] Layout component with side panels
- [x] Calendar view (2-week display)
- [x] Navigation controls for calendar

## 3. Database Schema
- [x] Design tables for:
  - Drivers (id, family_name, seat_capacity)
  - Kids (id, name)
  - Activities (id, name, day, time, location)
  - ActivityInstances (id, activity_id, date, is_cancelled)
  - DriverAssignments (id, activity_instance_id, driver_id)
  - KidAssignments (id, driver_assignment_id, kid_id)

## 4. Backend Development
- [x] Implement CRUD operations for:
  - Drivers management
  - Kids management
  - Activities management
  - Activity instances
  - Driver assignments
  - Kid assignments
- [x] Create weekly activity instance generator
- [ ] Configure Vercel deployment
- [ ] Set up Neon PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Set up serverless API routes in Vercel

### Management Panels
- [x] Drivers management panel
  - Add/edit/delete drivers
  - Display driver capacity
- [x] Kids management panel
  - Add/edit/delete kids
- [x] Activities management panel
  - Add/edit/delete activities
  - Set schedule details

### Calendar Features
- [x] Display activities per day
- [ ] Driver assignment interface
- [ ] Kid assignment interface
- [ ] Activity instance modification/cancellation
- [x] Week navigation (previous/next)

## 5. State Management
- [ ] Set up data fetching and caching
- [ ] Implement real-time updates
- [ ] Handle optimistic updates

## 6. UI/UX Refinements
- [x] Responsive design implementation
- [x] Loading states
- [x] Error handling
- [ ] Success notifications
- [ ] Confirmation dialogs

## 7. Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Basic component testing
- [ ] Integration testing
- [ ] Database migration setup
- [ ] Production deployment configuration

## Implementation Details

### Calendar View Architecture
- Two-week view implemented with nested components:
  - `Calendar`: Data fetching & state management
  - `CalendarWeek`: Week grid rendering
  - `ActivityCard`: Individual activity display
  - `AssignDriverModal`: Driver assignment interface

### Data Management
- Activity instances generated one week in advance
- Separate tables for activities and instances
- Driver assignments linked to specific instances
- Kid assignments linked to driver assignments

### UI Components
- Modal-based interfaces for assignments
- Hierarchical information display
- Consistent date/time formatting
- Loading & error state handling

### Database Operations
- CRUD endpoints for all entities
- Batch operations for instance generation
- Transaction support for assignments
- Efficient querying with proper indexing

Would you like me to add more specific details about any of these aspects?

## Implementation Notes

### Database Considerations
- Use Neon PostgreSQL for serverless compatibility
- Implement efficient queries for calendar view
- Set up proper indexing for frequent queries

### UI/UX Guidelines
- Clean, modern interface with world-class design
- Mobile-responsive design
- Intuitive driver and kid assignment
- Clear visual hierarchy for calendar events

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize calendar rendering
- Implement efficient data fetching
- Use appropriate caching strategies

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Email notifications
- Calendar export
- Recurring driver assignments
- Historical data views

This plan provides a structured approach to building the ride-sharing app while maintaining simplicity and focusing on core functionality. The implementation will prioritize user experience and ease of use while ensuring reliable data persistence through Neon PostgreSQL.
